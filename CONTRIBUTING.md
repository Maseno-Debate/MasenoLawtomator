## 📌 **Code Style Guidelines (Betty-Inspired)**

1. **Indentation**: Use **4 spaces per level**, no tabs.
2. **Line Length**: Prefer **≤ 80 characters per line**; break long lines with `_` in VBA.
3. **Naming Conventions**:

   * Modules: `macro_name_module`
   * Macros/Subs: `ActionDescription_Object` (e.g., `Format_Document`)
   * Variables: lowercase with underscores (e.g., `total_cases`)
4. **Spacing**:

   * One blank line between logical blocks
   * Avoid trailing spaces
5. **Comments**:

   * Top-level comment block for every macro describing purpose, author, and usage
   * Inline comments for key logic or complex steps
6. **Structure & Syntax**:

   * Always close blocks properly: `End Sub`, `End Function`, `End If`, etc.
   * Indent blocks consistently
7. **Consistency**: Maintain style consistent with the repository standards

> PRs or submissions not following Betty-inspired principles may be returned for corrections.
