# 📘 **MasenoLawtomator**

*A starter collection of VBA macros for Maseno University law students.*

---

## 🎓 **Overview**

**MasenoLawtomator** is a lightweight, early-stage legal automation toolkit designed to help law students at **Maseno University School of Law** work faster and produce better-formatted documents.

This initial version focuses **only on Microsoft Word VBA macros**, allowing students to automate repetitive tasks such as formatting, numbering, citations, and document cleanup.

As the project grows, more scripts, templates, and tools will be added—starting simple, but building toward a full legal-tech toolkit.
